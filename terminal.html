<h3>
    Linux/UNIX shell script Terminal
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank">Bash</a> (Borne Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language. It follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" target="_blank">POSIX</a> standard.
</p>
<p>
    Hidden files and folders are preceeded by a single dot. Listing permissions will indicate a dash for normal file, d for directory, c for character and some more I am not familiar with currently.
</p>
<p>
    Variables are declared without a keyword, and accessed through the <code>$</code> symbol.
</p>

<h3>
    Manual Pages
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Bash has built in manuals for many apps (commands) to help the user understand its purpose and syntax. To open a manual simply type: <br />
    <code>man</code> followed by the command, separated by space. Example: <code>man ssh</code>
</p>
<p>
    To navigate we use arrow keys as well as <q>u, d, b, f</q>. The up and down moves half a page, while the back and forward keys move the full page. To search we press <q>/</q> followed by search word. scroll to next result is accomplished with the <q>n</q> key; and to quit we press <q>q</q>.
</p>

<h3>
    Command syntax
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    A command normally follows a standard syntax. first app name then flags preceeded by a single or double dash, then arguments. Flags can in many cases be joined together like <code>ls -alhF</code> instead of <code>ls -a -l -h -F</code>.<br />
    <code>ls -a1hF --color --group-directories-first /dev</code>
</p>

<h3>
    StdIn, StdOut, StdError and streams
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Std-in is for us the keyboard input but also a file or an input directed by the user. 0>
</p>
<h4>
    /dev directory
</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    A interesting location which contains inputs and outputs that at first glance appears as files. These items can be used to interact directly with hardware and offer some handy outputs like random numbers (random and urandom), a black hole (zero) eating anything sent in, and many more. Use with caution!
</p>

<h3>Single vs Double Quotes</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Single Quotes</h4>
        Enclosing characters in single quotes <code>'</code> preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Double Quotes</h4>
        Enclosing characters in double quotes <code>"</code> preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <code>$</code>, <code>`</code>, <code>\</code> and <code>,</code> when history expansion is enabled, !. The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes (see Shell Expansions). The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or newline. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an <code>!</code> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the <code>!</code> is not removed.<br />
        The special parameters <code>*</code> and <code>@</code> have special meaning when in double quotes.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Newline</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Newlines in print statements can be achieved in a few different ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Straight forward echo
        <pre>
        echo "I'm writing on"
        echo
        echo "two lines"
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>echo -e (enabling backslash escape interpretation)
        <pre>
        echo -e "I'm writing on\ntwo lines"
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>printf (widely supported)
        <pre>
        printf "I'm writing on\ntwo lines\n"
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Long commands newlines</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    As commands grow long it is convenient to split them over several lines. This is achieved by escaping the newline character (enter) with the backslash.
</p>

<h3>Built in Variables</h3>

<h3>Scripting</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Writing scripts in bash is a convenient way of automating tasks. Scripts commonly has the <q>.sh</q> file extension, though this is not necessary. <br>
    In bash we can mark any file executable with the change app. In most cases the command <code>chmod 755 filename</code> or simpler <code>chmod +x filename</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Chmod arguments 755 denotes the level of file or directory permissions over 3 user accounts. 7 indicates full permission for the owner (read, write and execute), read and execute for same group users and the same priviliges for other users.<br />
    Chmod with the +x argument simply adds the <q>execute</q> permission to all users.
</p>
<p>
    For a script to work in itself we need to add a <q>shebang</q> to line 1: <code>#!/bin/bash</code><br />
    A feature of seing the commands executed by a script can be achieved by adding the <code>-x</code> flag after the <q>shebang</q>.
</p>
<p>
    We can declare variables, write functions, run loops and contitional statements like other programming languages. The principles are similar to C but the syntax is slightly different.
</p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/bash

    # Ping script outputting stats to external log file
    #
    # Two arguments are required and the ping command will run until stopped
    #
    # First argument is the address to ping
    # Second argument is the time interval in minutes for sending statistics to external log file
    #
    # Logfile location and name
    logfile=~/ping.log;
    logLen=50;
    
    # Passed arguments
    IP=$1;
    SLEEP=$2;
    
    pingStats() {
        # store process id to PID variable
        PID=$!;
    
        # declare command variable as non empty string to allow for loop to start
        command='start';
    
        # do loop until command variable length is Zero
        until [ -z command ]
        do
            # set interval
            sleep "${SLEEP}m";
            # add timestamp to log entry
            echo "Pinging $IP on $(date)" >> "$logfile";
            # send quit signal to trigger ping status
            kill -SIGQUIT "$PID";
            # delete two first lines when log exceeds 50 lines
            if [[ $logLines -gt 50 ]]
            then
                sed -i '1,2d' "$logfile";
            fi;
            # update command variable
            command=$(ps "$PID" | grep -o ping);
            # update size of logfile
            logLines=$(wc -l $logfile | grep -Po '\d+');
        done;
    }
    
    # Starting ping application
    ping -O "$IP" 2>> "$logfile" & pingStats;
</pre>

<h3>Network</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    The abstraction layers in networking are link, internet, transport and the application layers. Communication goes exclusively between these and no steps are skipped along the route.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>link: utilise MAC addresses when communicating together. Ethernet, ISDN, ADSL, Fiber, WiFi ethernet. This is the network card communicating with another network card on a local network.</li>
    <li>internet: utilise the Internet Protocol IP. This is a router communicating with another router on the Internet. Package loss is acceptable in this protocoll.</li>
    <li>transport: utilise Port numbers. TCP and UDP are the protocols. TCP is the work horse which checks if packages are lost and querries for new if so. UDP is a simple shell which doesn't query package loss.<br />
        Naturally one would see the benefit of TCP when accurat data is transported, however when speed is prioritiesed UDP can be of benefit in examples like streaming and VoIP communications.</li>
    <li>application: Broad term for all softwares using the internet. Email clients, Streaming apps, HTTP and HTTPS...</li>
</ol>
<p>
    To move up and down the layers we use different tools. Network cards help us in the link layer, along with routers that can communicate through multiple protocols in the same layer, as well as elevate the communication to the internet layers.
</p>
<p>
    Switches are used to split the communication between multiple devices. These are only allowing communication between the requested MAC addressed unlike the predated <q>hubs</q>, which sent the same data to all the devices slowing communication drastically.
</p>
<p>
    Netmask or subnet mask determines the size of the subnet, or how many IP addresses should be made available for the network.
</p>
<p>
    IP addresses are 32 bit long as well as a mask. However it is common to refer to the mask in bits despite this, which simply means where to split the IP. If a mask is say 24 bits, it means the first 24 bits in any subnet address must be the same, and the last 8 bits can be utilised for the clients, in decimal this comes to 256 IP addresses. 2 addresses are reserved which gives the opportunity for there to be 254 clients in this subnet.<br />
    24 bits are the most common in home networks and it translates into 255.255.255.0, which in a normal home network will allow clients to occupy the IP range from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254.
</p>

<h3>Git - Version Control</h3>
<hr />
<p>
	Git is a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds. There are multiple commands to get started. And everything in a filesystem can be version controlled this way. Tracking changes to be able to go back in time and even start again.
</p>
<p>
    The <q>working tree</q> is where we do our current changes to our files. If changing between branches and commits the files in our repository's directory reflects these changes. As example we have a blank README.md file in main branch but with content on our dev branch. Checking out dev we can see the content. Changing back to main we have the blank file.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>git init - Makes current directory a repository (project). This can be the directory where the files I want a record of recide.</li>
    <li>git init --bare name.git - Creates a bare repository commonly denoted with .git extension. This will not contain a working tree as no branches will be checked out. It hold all the information of a working repository but they are used as backups or main peer repos. gitHub repos are <q>bare</q>.</li>
	<li>git add 'filename / *.txt' - Adds file or files to the repository, either new or modified. They are now in staging, which is a place to reflect over the changes before committing to them. Stage can be regretted.<br />
	<code>echo <q>Repository Description<q> &gt; README.md & git add README.md</code></li>
	<li>git status - dispays status of files not commited to repository.</li>
    <li>git log - display log of commits with # and messages.</li>
	<li>git commit 'filename / *.txt' -m 'Text to be added' - The modified file is now added to the git repository as a permanent file.</li>
    <li>git commit -am 'message' - stages and commits in one go. -a add and -m message.</li>
    <li>git config
        <ul>
            <li>git config --global user.email "tomstoreboe@gmail.com"</li>
            <li>git config --global user.name "Tom Storeboe"</li>
            <li>author 'Tom Storeboe' -add (double tap Tab after config lists available options in the config file).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>git branch - displays branches.</li>
    <li>git branch -a - displays all branches remote and local (if remote data has been <q>fetched</q>).</li>
    <li>git checkout 'dev' - checks out (swaps) to working on 'dev' branch. <strong>Note:</strong> Local directory content changes when doing this.</li>
    <li>git checkout -b 'dev' - creates and checks out 'dev' branch.</li>
    <li>git merge dev - pulls dev into checked out branch.</li>
    <li>git tag - lists tags on commit.</li>
    <li>git tag v0.0.3 - creates a tag.</li>
    <li>git tag -d 'v0.0.3' - deletes tag with name 'v0.0.3'.</li>
    <li>git stash push - push file to top of stash.</li>
    <li>git stash pop - pops the file at top of stash back to checked out branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some convenient rules to follow when managing the repository are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Keep main branch functional e.g. as a working code and not under development.</li>
    <li>Only work on one branch at a time, and merge it in when finished.</li>
    <li>Split developments to a new branch (dev or feat commonly used) to be merged with main and then deleted.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Merge and Fast-Forward Merge</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The <code>git merge</code> command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.<br />
    The merge commit has two parents formed by the two branches.
</p>
<p>
    A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch as in the main branch has remained unchanged since the forking branch was created.<br />
    Instead of “actually” merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move (i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip. This effectively combines the histories, since all of the commits reachable from the target branch are now available through the current one.
</p>
<p>
    Git defaults to <q>fast forward merge</q> if possible. To control this we can use flags:
</p>
<pre>
    git merge --ff-only
    git merge --no-ff
</pre>
<p>
    We checkout the branch we want as master, and pull the branch to be merged into this branch. The example has two commit message paragraphs indicated by the two <code>-m</code> flags:
</p>
<pre>
    git checkout main
    git merge --no-ff dev -m 'Merging the Developed version with main' -m 'This enables a bunch of new features'
</pre>

<h4>Tags and Annotated Tags</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>Tags - Used as post-it notes. Temporary lightweight note.</li>
    <li>Annotaded Tags - Permanent descriptive note.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Example:
</p>
<pre>
    // Applying settings to all git projects on user
    git config --global user.email "myEmail@server.com"
    git config --global user.name "My Name"
    git config --global author.name "My Name"
    // Inside directory where we want to have files version controlled
    git init -b Main
    // Creates repo initialised with branch named Main. Default is Master
    echo 'Readme file explaining the repository' 2> README.md
    git add README.md file1
    // Puts two files into staging, where one reflects over the changes
    git commit -m 'Initial commit message'
    // Commits the two files to the repository
    git checkout -b 'Feature'
    // Creates new branch Feature starting at Head if not specified otherwise and check out branch
    git branch -m 'Dev'
    // Change name on checked out branch
    git commit -am 'New Development Finished'
    // Commit changes directly
    git checkout main; git merge Dev; git branch -d Dev;
    // Checkout main branch before merging Dev into it, followed by deleting Dev branch
    git log --one-line
    // Display the log file with title and abbreviated hash
    git commit -am "commit 'modified' files without staging"
    // Does not include newly added files
</pre>

<h4>Editing on Wrong Branch</h4>
<p>
    In the above example things were done correctly. However if we forget to checkout the right branch before editing files, we can "stash" our file after saving it, switch to desired branch, collect our file from the "stash" and commit it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>git stash push ("myFile") - pushes the current or specified file to the top of the stash, allowing us to navigate branches.</li>
    <li>git stash pop ("index") - pops the file from the top of the stash or as specified by the index number. <code>git stash pop 0</code> is at the top.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Git Remote and Cloud Repositories (gitHub)</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    To backup git versioned work onto a cloud server we have a few options in the likes of gitLab or gitHub among some. The latter being the most used and now managed by Microsoft, who has agreed to let it remain free for private users and with free storage.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>git remote add gitHub git@gitHub:user/repository.git - Adds remote repo named gitHub.</li>
    <li>git remote add backup ssh://pi:/home/pi/backup.git - Adds remote repo backup with ssh connection. IP and ports can be specified if needed.</li>
    <li>git remote remove OldRepo - remove reference to repository named OldRepo.</li>
    <li>git status - tells us if local and remote repositories are in sync. This might require fetching or pulling if no upstream <q>tracking</q> is used.</li>
    <li>git ls-remote origin - list remote repository origin's files.</li>
    <li>git fetch origin - Downloads objects and references from remote repository origin.</li>
    <li>git push -all origin - pushes all branches to remote repository named origin.</li>
    <li>git push -u remoteRepNichName - pushes commits to remote repository. The -u enables the <q>tracking</q> of the remote upstream repository to the local, fetching it behind the scenes.</li>
    <li>git clone git@gitHub:user/repository.git - saves a copy of the remote repository to the local harddrive.</li>
    <li>git clone -b dev git@gitHub:user/repositoy.git - clones the dev branch from the remote repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some git and gitHub jargon explained:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remote - Any repository which is not the current one <q>local</q> in use. A remote can be anythign between a cloud server to a different location on the same computer.</li>
    <li>Origin - The origin of the current repository.</li>
    <li>Upstream - The origin of the origin.</li>
    <li>Pull request - A term used in gitHub alone representing a "suggested" commit to the owner of a repository.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Git Merge Conflict</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    If there has been modifications to the <u>same lines</u> in a file in two or more separate branches before merging is attempted, a "merge conflict" occurs.<br />
    As a file can be composed of all kinds of languages git is unable to determine which branch version to keep.<br />
    Information to where the conflict has occured is then added to the concerned file, indicated by chevrons surrounding the conflict, separated by equal signs between the choices. To resolve we delete the obsolete choice and save the file, before staging and committing it and finally merging it into the branch of choice.
</p>

<h3>Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        MAJOR version when you make <span style="background-color: rgb(197, 224, 75);">incompatible API changes</span>.<br />
        It <u>may</u> also include minor and patch level changes.<br />
        Patch and minor version <u>must</u> be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.
    </li>
    <li>

<h3>TMUX - Terminal Multiplexer</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    TMUX is a tool for keeping a session alive if connection is interrupted e.g. if performing work on a remote server with an unstable connection, it prevents the abortion of applications as they are running on remote system, the local simply tapping into it.
</p>
<p>
    List sessions with <code>tmux ls</code>. Start a new session with a custom name with <code>tmux new -s 'newTmuxSession'</code>. Stop all sessions with <code>tmux kill-server</code>.
</p>
<p>
    TMUX offers much more than just that with multiple screens and automated start and more.<br />
    <code>CTRL-b</code> is the key shortcut to enter command mode. From here a great variety of key commands follows. A handful useful examples in <i>command mode</i> are:
</p>
<ul>
    <ul class="no_bullet_list">Manipulation:
        <li>c - create new window.</li>
        <li>! - break pane free from window.</li>
        <li>z - zoom selected pane.</li>
        <li>% - split window vertically into two panes.</li>
        <li>" - split window horisontally into two panes.</li>
        <li>space - select next window preset layout.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no_bullet_list">Navigation:
        <li>n - next window.</li>
        <li>p - previous window.</li>
        <li>0-9 - select between windows.</li>
        <li>o - select next pane.</li>
        <li>; - previous active pane.</li>
        <li>w - interactive window menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no_bullet_list">Termination:
        <li>& - kill current window.</li>
        <li>x - kill current pane.</li>
        <li>Ctrl+z - suspend client.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Use man page for TMUX or simply list commands with <code>tmux lscm</code> and pipe result to grep to extract the syntax that tickles your fancy. E.g: <code>tmux lscm | grep window</code>.
</p>

<h4>Scripting with Commands</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    A powerful feature with TMUX is the ability to run individual commands in separate panes and windows, all initiated automatically during the creation of these items.
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

session=Tom;

start=$(tmux new  -s $session -n Bash \;\
		split-window top \;\
		split-window 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' \;\
		select-layout main-horizontal \;\
		new-window 'ssh pi' \;\
		select-window -t 0 \;\
		select-pane -t 0);

tmux a -t $session || $start;
