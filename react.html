<h3>React</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    React is an Open Source library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.
</p>
<p>
    React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable.<br />
    JSX syntax: <code>const component = &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;h1/&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    Because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: <code>{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }</code>.<br />
    However JSX must be compiled into JavaScript before it can be used by the browser, and the transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.
</p>
<p>
    All JSX elements needs to be wrapped up in a parent element to work. Usually accomplished by the use of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.
</p>
<p>
    With React, we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.<br />
    ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: <code>ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)</code>, where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
</p>
<p>
    As you would expect, <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.
</p>
<p>
    In JSX you can no longer use the word <q>class</q> to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses <code>className</code>.<br />
    The naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is <code>onClick</code>, instead of <q>onclick</q>. Likewise, <q>onchange</q> becomes <code>onChange</code>
</p>
<p>
    Simple react component:
</p>
<pre>
const myComponent = (
    &lt;div id='parent_tag'&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
);
{/* rendering to HTML */}
ReactDOM.render(&lt;myComponent /&gt;, document.querySelector('#main'));
</pre>

<h4>Self closing Tags</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.
</p>
<p>
    For example the line-break tag can be written as &lt;br&gt; or as &lt;br /&gt;, but should never be written as &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;, since it doesn't contain any content.
</p>
<p>
    In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as &lt;br /&gt; in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A &lt;div&gt;, on the other hand, can be written as &lt;div /&gt; or &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the &lt;div /&gt;.
</p>

<h4>Components are Everything</h4>
<hr />
<p>
    Components are the core of React and there are two ways to create a React component.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The use of a JavaScript function creates a <q>stateless functional component</q>. A component that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. A <q>stateless functional component</q> is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A <q>stateless component</q>, on the other hand, is a class that <code>extends React.Component</code>, but does not use internal state</li>
    <li>The use of ES6 class syntax creates a component which extends a parent class, inheriting all its features. Such as local state and lifecycle hooks. This is what is called a <q>stateful</q> component, which is a class component that maintain its own internal state. Stateful components are often referred to simply as components or React components.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.
</p>
<p>
    To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
</p>
<pre>
    const MyComponent = function() {
        return (
            &lt;div className='customClass' /&gt;
        );
    };
</pre>
<p>
    To create a component with the class syntax we use the <code>extends</code> to call the parent class, and in the constructor method we call the properties of the parent into the child instances. Then it looks more familiar as the JS functions return.
</p>
<pre>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;Hello React!&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;
            )
        }
    };
</pre>
<p>
    Composing components together is made easy with inserting the component name within a self closing tag as shown in the example:
</p>
<pre>
    class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;I am the child&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
    class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;I am the parent&lt;/h1&gt;
                    { /* Add the Child component */ }
                    &lt;ChildComponent /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
</pre>

<h4>Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;App&gt;
        &lt;Welcome user='Tatiana' /&gt;
    &lt;/App&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    You use <u>custom HTML attributes</u> created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:
</p>
<pre>
    const Welcome = (props) => &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.user}!&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.
</p>
<pre>
    const CurrentDate = (props) =&gt; {
        return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            { /* The property is accessed using supported custom attribute */ }
            &lt;p&gt;The current date is: {props.date}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };
      
    class Calendar extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;What date is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
                { /* custom supported "date" attribute passed to CurrentDate*/ }
                &lt;CurrentDate date={Date()}/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };  
</pre>

<h4>Access Props Using this.props</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    If the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.
</p>
<pre>
    class ReturnTempPassword extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                { /* Accessing "this" syntax */ }
                &lt;p&gt;Your temporary password is: &lt;strong&gt;{ this.props.tempPassword }&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
      
    class ResetPassword extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Reset Password&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;We've generated a new temporary password for you.&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;Please reset this password from your account settings ASAP.&lt;/h3&gt;
                { /* Passing the "custom" attribute and prop */ }
                &lt;ReturnTempPassword tempPassword = { '12414355434' } /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
</pre>

<h4>Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.
</p>
<p>
    It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:
</p>
<pre>
    MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
</pre>
<p>
    In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. Adding isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component. You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: <code>import PropTypes from 'prop-types';</code>
</p>

<h4>State</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    One of the most important topics in React is <q>state</q>. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.
</p>
<p>
    You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
this.state = {
  // describe your state here
}
</pre>
<p>
    You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.
</p>
<pre>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                name: 'Initial State'
            };
            this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
        }
        handleClick() {
            this.setState(
            {
                name: 'Reach is Difficult but Ok!'
            }
            );
        }
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
</pre>
<p>
    React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use <code>this.setState()</code> when state changes occur.<br />
    Note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the <i>setState</i> method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the <i>setState</i> method which provides a way around this problem. The <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html" target="_blank">React documentation</a> contains further details.
</p>

<h4>Bind the <q>this</q> keyword to the class</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    A class method typically needs to use the <q>this</q> keyword so it can access properties of the class itself inside the scope of the method. As <q>this</q> inside the class constructor gets bound to the instances the constructor builds, we need a way to bind <q>this</q> to the class itself rather than the instances. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to get that access.<br />
    One common way is to explicitly bind <q>this</q> in the constructor to the class, <q>this</q> then becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized.
</p>
<pre>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                text: "Hello"
            };
            // Binding this to the class
            this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
        }
        handleClick() {
            this.setState({
                text: "You clicked!"
            });
        }
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.text}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };
</pre>
<p>
    Sometimes a state needs to be tracked, for intance with a toggle where there need to be a memory of previous state. As there might be multiple state changes in an app this, is best achieved by passing arguments of current state to the <q>setter</q> method.
</p>
<pre>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                visibility: false
            };
            // Binding this to the class rather than the instance //
            this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
        }
        // Class method with a setter method passed the "current" state as argument //
        // Allowing to toggle the state property between true and false //
        toggleVisibility() {
            this.setState(state =&gt; ({
                visibility: state.visibility ? false : true
            }));      
        }
        render() {
            if (this.state.visibility) {
                return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;Now you see me!&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                );
            }
            else {
                return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                );
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
    The next example shows a counter, initialised to 0 with controls to increment, decrement and reset the counter.
</p>
<pre>
    class Counter extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                count: 0
            };
            // Binding methods to the class and not the instances //
            this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
            this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
            this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
        }
        // Methods for changing values //
        increment() {
            this.setState(state =&gt; ({
                count: state.count + 1
            }))
        };
        decrement() {
            this.setState(state =&gt; ({
                count: state.count - 1
            }))
        };
        reset() {
            this.setState ({
                count: 0
            })
        };
        render() {
            return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}&gt;Increment!&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}&gt;Decrement!&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Current Count: {this.state.count}&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    };

<h4>Controlling input</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    When typing the input text field is updated on the fly. When submit is pressed it displays the submitted text.
</p>
<pre>
    class MyForm extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                input: '',
                submit: ''
            };
            // binding "this" to instances and not the class
            this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
            this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        }
        // method storing input changes
        handleChange(event) {
            this.setState({
                input: event.target.value
            });
        }
        // method storing submitted text
        handleSubmit(event) {
            this.setState({
                submit: this.state.input
            });
            // method preventing document refresh with submit button
            event.preventDefault();
        }
        render() {

                    &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Submit!&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;{ this.state.submit }&lt;/h1&gt;
